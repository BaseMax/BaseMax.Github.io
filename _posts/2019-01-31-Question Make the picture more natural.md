title: A question about making the picture more natural.
---

Although this is a simple question and easy...
But it can be interesting for many people.

I saw this question at Stanford University.
And thanks to the professor.


# Question 1

Write code to fix the poppy.png image which should show an orange California Poppy in the foreground (the California state flower!).

The background is mostly green with some in the upper-right.

### Primary Pseudo Code Sample

```
image = new SimpleImage("poppy.png");
for (pixel: image) {
   //Complate Here...
}
print(image);
```

### Description about functions

```
pixel.setBlue( <number> );
pixel.setGreen( <number> );
pixel.setRed( <number> );
```

```
pixel.getRed()
pixel.getGreen()
pixel.getBlue()
```


### How Solve

At the first, you need to know **Poppy California**.
And how it looks.
