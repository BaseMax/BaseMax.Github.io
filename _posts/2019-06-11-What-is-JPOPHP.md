title: What is the JPOPHP?
---

**JPOPHP** (JSON Parser Object PHP) is a library for parsing the data in JSON format.

Some things are interesting.
Some things help a lot of people.

Making time more valuable.

I spent a little time completing the program and fixing the problem.
I also wrote several unit-tests for the end of the collaboration.

After that, I thought that if this library was released based on **PHP** it could also help other programmers.

This was the reason why this small library was published as **PHP**-based library.

Based on a message that I recently received, we changed the name of this library to **JPOPHP**.

I hoping can more help to humans.
