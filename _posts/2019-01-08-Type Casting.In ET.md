title: Type Casting in ET Programming Language
---

Some programming language does not require explicit type definition in the variable declaration.

That is to say, if an integer value is assigned to the variable $value, $value becomes an integer.
If a string value is then assigned to $value, it becomes a string.

a variable's type is determined by the context in which the variable is used. (automatic)
