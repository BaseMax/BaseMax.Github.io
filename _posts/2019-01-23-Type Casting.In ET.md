title: Type Casting in ET Programming Language
---

Some programming language does not require explicit type definition in the variable declaration.

That is to say, if an integer value is assigned to the variable $value, $value becomes an integer.
If a string value is then assigned to $value, it becomes a string.

a variable's type is determined by the context in which the variable is used. (automatic)

#### An example:


```
main()
{
	age=5+1+2+4*2
	
	ab=5*4+4*1
	ab=4+100-5*2*4.6
	
	an=4.6

	ab=5*(4-1)
	ab=5*4-1
}
```
