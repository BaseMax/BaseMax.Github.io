title: Part3 Questions about making the picture more natural.

Although this is a simple question and easy...
But it can be interesting for many people.

I saw this question at Stanford University.
And thanks to the professor.


# Question 1

Goal: change the red sign to be blue

# Question 3





Suppose you are visiting Stanford and you park your car here, and get a parking ticket. Philosophically, they say that you are better off taking in events as they have actually happened. Nonetheless, here we'll try to fix history in code. 

Challenge: write code to detect the red curb, (a) change it to medium gray red=120 green=120 blue=120. (b) change just the red curb to be grayscale, which will look more realistic. Rather than changing the whole image to grayscale, we change just the red areas. Recall that the algorithm to change grayscale is to set red/green/blue values all to be the average value.

# Question 4

Tune the * 1.5 to detect the red areas
Setting to solid gray (120, 120, 120) looks a little crude
Note that we put gray on the red plants to the right
Our strategy chooses exclusively on pixel color, so necessarily get the red plants too
(b) Rather than (120, 120, 120), change the red pixels to grayscale
This looks much better, as it reflects the dark/light of the real curb
Just draining out the red
Conclusions:
