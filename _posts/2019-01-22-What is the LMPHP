title: What is the LMPHP?
---

**LMPHP** is a library for multi-language support in the PHP-based application backends.

Some things are interesting.
Some things help a lot of people.
Some small and simple things can help others.

Making time more valuable.

In 2018, when I received a message from a team in India about completing the system.
I spent a little time completing the program and fixing the problem.
I also wrote several unit-tests for the end of the collaboration.

After that, I thought that if this library was released based on **PHP** it could also help other programmers.

This was the reason why this small library was published as **PHP**-based library.

Based on a message that I recently received, we changed the name of this library to **LMPHP**. (Ver 1.1)

I hoping can more help to humans.
