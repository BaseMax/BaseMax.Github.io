In any case, this can be generalized to humans.

Humans are different
Some of them work just for their position.
And some to help and progress others around.

There are also other categories that appear in both types,
but prefer their positions in sensitive situations.

I've heard this recently from a professor.
A person has managed and engineered more than 200 valuable buildings.
No cost (religious buildings are worth billions)

He is a famous person in the region.

One who can relate transitive concepts of mathematics, such as integral, and so on to the unity of God.

It's so important.
While talking to a professor
Will he really want to hear and help you?


I spoke with another professor last night about finding the new prime number ... he did not show much interest.

And he did not behave well.

My initial question was: Have you ever made progress and helped others?

Because I wrote an article too.
He did even not read the text.
In a few seconds, he looked at the sheets
And said well.

At least some minutes he should be checked on the sheets.
