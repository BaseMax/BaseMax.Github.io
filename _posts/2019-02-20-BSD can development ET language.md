title: Beginning of BSD can have an impact on the development of ET language?
---

Less than a month, we have a special look at Unix.

It may be more important to develop in this environment.
Or maybe not.

### Begin and log into BSD?

Depending on the environment and conditions.
They are a good operating system that has a long history of development and life.
And in commercial use it is still among the most popular and widely used items.


Is it imagined that the ET Programming Language has a good coverage of these systems?
