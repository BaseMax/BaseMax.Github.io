title: Cooperation in a Bank Project - Artificial Intelligence 
---

One of the acquaintances recently offered a proposal for collaboration in a project.

### Dangerous suggestion

Its main topic is artificial intelligence/price analysis.
This project is for one of the banks.
Although this is a big project.

They decide to use the **ET programming language** for it.

I do not know about them and I do not know exactly what the bank is ...
Although They are asked me to attend the meetings.
I don't know where is that!

I have not made any decision yet.
