title: Attend the Linux User Group (LUG)
---

It was an opportunity for me to be invited and i can be there.

It was a workshop for students in the field of computer science.


It seemed that they held LUGs each month.
Because it was not the first part.
I'm glad I was able to attend this day and I was invited.


Different topics were raised by people.

Topics :

- What is Linux?
- What is Open Source?
- What is free software?
- Open Source Difference and Free Software?
- Licensing GPL?
- What is GIT?
- How to use GIT?
- Doing a GIT project?
- How using Github site?
